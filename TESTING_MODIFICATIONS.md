# Testing Modifications Documentation

## Changes Made for Local Testing (Limited to 20 Files)

### File: `/backend/app.py`

**Location**: Lines 176-198 in the `discover_and_download_pdfs` function

**Changes Made**:
1. **Line 176-179**: Added testing limitation logic
   ```python
   # TESTING MODIFICATION: Limit downloads to 20 files for local testing
   # TO REVERT: Remove the [:20] slice below to download all files
   limited_pdf_links = all_pdf_links[:20]
   progress_callback(f"TESTING MODE: Limited to {len(limited_pdf_links)} files (out of {len(all_pdf_links)} found)", 50)
   ```

2. **Line 183**: Changed loop to use `limited_pdf_links` instead of `all_pdf_links`
   ```python
   for i, pdf_info in enumerate(limited_pdf_links):
   ```

3. **Line 189**: Updated progress calculation to use `limited_pdf_links`
   ```python
   progress = 50 + (40 * (i + 1) / len(limited_pdf_links))
   ```

4. **Line 190**: Updated progress message to use `limited_pdf_links`
   ```python
   progress_callback(f"Downloaded {successful_downloads}/{len(limited_pdf_links)} files", int(progress))
   ```

5. **Line 198**: Updated completion message to show testing mode
   ```python
   jobs_status[job_id]["message"] = f"Download complete! {successful_downloads}/{len(limited_pdf_links)} files downloaded (TESTING MODE: limited from {len(all_pdf_links)} total)"
   ```

## How to Revert Changes

To restore full download functionality:

1. **Remove the testing limitation** (Lines 176-179):
   ```python
   # Delete these lines:
   # TESTING MODIFICATION: Limit downloads to 20 files for local testing
   # TO REVERT: Remove the [:20] slice below to download all files
   limited_pdf_links = all_pdf_links[:20]
   progress_callback(f"TESTING MODE: Limited to {len(limited_pdf_links)} files (out of {len(all_pdf_links)} found)", 50)
   ```

2. **Restore original loop** (Line 183):
   ```python
   # Change from:
   for i, pdf_info in enumerate(limited_pdf_links):
   # Back to:
   for i, pdf_info in enumerate(all_pdf_links):
   ```

3. **Restore original progress calculations** (Lines 189-190):
   ```python
   # Change from:
   progress = 50 + (40 * (i + 1) / len(limited_pdf_links))
   progress_callback(f"Downloaded {successful_downloads}/{len(limited_pdf_links)} files", int(progress))
   # Back to:
   progress = 50 + (40 * (i + 1) / len(all_pdf_links))
   progress_callback(f"Downloaded {successful_downloads}/{len(all_pdf_links)} files", int(progress))
   ```

4. **Restore original completion message** (Line 198):
   ```python
   # Change from:
   jobs_status[job_id]["message"] = f"Download complete! {successful_downloads}/{len(limited_pdf_links)} files downloaded (TESTING MODE: limited from {len(all_pdf_links)} total)"
   # Back to:
   jobs_status[job_id]["message"] = f"Download complete! {successful_downloads}/{len(all_pdf_links)} files downloaded"
   ```

## Summary

These changes limit the download process to only the first 20 PDF files found during discovery, making local testing faster and more manageable. All other functionality remains unchanged.
